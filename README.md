## Let's get started with our first task of this Scavenger hunt.

### Rules: 

You have to add one or few lines to the existing poetry in "Poetry.txt" file. Here are few rules on how to add to the same:

**1. Maintain Consistency**: Keep a consistent theme, tone, or imagery throughout the poem. This helps the poem feel cohesive and focused.

**2. Expand on Ideas**: If you've introduced an idea or concept in the earlier lines, use the subsequent lines to delve deeper into that idea, providing more details, emotions, or perspectives.

**3. Vary Line Lengths**: Experiment with different line lengths. Short lines can create a sense of urgency or contemplation, while longer lines can offer a more leisurely and expansive feel.

**4. Use Metaphors and Similes**: Metaphors and similes add layers of meaning to your poetry. They can help you convey complex emotions or concepts in a relatable way.

**5. Rhythmic Flow**: Consider the rhythm of your poem. The choice of words and the arrangement of stressed and unstressed syllables can create a pleasing rhythm that enhances the poem's musicality.
